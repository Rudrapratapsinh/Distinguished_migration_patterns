Migration Patterns: Global and India-Specific Analysis

1. Objective of the Project

This project explores migration patterns globally, with a focus on India. It aims to identify key trends, drivers, and impacts of migration, 
using data analysis and visualization to provide insights into migration flows, demographics, and socio-economic factors.

2. Tools and Libraries Used

Python: Core programming language

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: Numerical computations

Geopandas: Geospatial data handling

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive data exploration

SQL: Data querying and manipulation (optional)


3. Data Source(s)

UN Migration Data Portal: Global migration statistics

World Bank: Global migration and remittances data

Census of India: Internal migration data within India

Open Government Data Platform India: Additional datasets on Indian migration


Execution Steps (How to run the project)

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/migration-patterns.git  
cd migration-patterns


2. Set up a virtual environment:

python -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac  
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows


3. Install required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


5. Follow the notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.



Summary of Results

Identified major global migration corridors (e.g., South Asia to the Middle East).

Highlighted internal migration trends in India, including rural-to-urban shifts.

Showed how economic opportunities, education, and environmental factors influence migration.

Visualized patterns such as seasonal migration and urban concentration.



Challenges Faced

Data Availability: Limited or incomplete data for some regions and years.

Data Cleaning: Handling inconsistent formats and missing values across datasets.

Geospatial Analysis: Complexity in mapping large-scale migration flows accurately.

Language Barriers: Documentation and datasets in regional languages required translations.
