## Introduction
This project explores migration patterns within India and globally. Using data-driven analysis, we aim to understand key trends, factors influencing migration, and the socio-economic impact. The project involves data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization of migration flows.

## Objective
The objective is to identify and visualize migration trends, uncover key insights, and present a clear understanding of patterns in population movement over time.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- (Add any additional libraries here)

## Data Sources
- (Include the datasets or public data repositories used for the project)
- Mention sources such as census data, UN migration reports, or any open datasets.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/[Group_Name]/Migration_Patterns_Analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd Migration_Patterns_Analysis

3. Install the required libraries:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Load the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts from the `src/` folder.
2. Execute the analysis scripts as described in the documentation.
3. View generated visualizations in the `visuals/` folder.

## Analysis and Insights
- Provide a summary of key findings, such as:
  - Major migration routes
  - Seasonal migration trends
  - Economic and social factors driving migration

## Visualizations
- Include sample visualizations like:
  - Heatmaps showing migration density
  - Line charts tracking migration trends over time
  - Comparative bar charts for rural vs. urban migration

## Challenges Faced
- Data cleaning issues (e.g., missing or incomplete data)
- Handling large datasets
- Visualizing complex migration patterns
